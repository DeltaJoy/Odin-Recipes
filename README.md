For this project I will be taking a look at 3 recipes. My favorite pie which is Key Lime Pie, my favorite type of cookie which is Peanut Butter Cookies, and finally a treat that I never had before called Coconut Ladoo. 

For this, I plan on creating the index page which will include possibly a gif or a picture under the title. Under that, my plan is to include a quick HREF link to each of these dessert recipes. 

I want to include a "back to home page" tab that allows the user to for example click into the Key Lime Pie recipe and then click the HREF to go back to the orginal page.

Each specific recipe will include an organized list of step my step process as well as an unorganized list of items needed

Finally, each page will have a credits HREF to a website that I took the recipe from. For example I will hyperlink the "Recipe Credits" into this wording,
